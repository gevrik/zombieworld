Zombieworld is a simple adventure game for Android mobile phones that I made for Halloween 2009.

You play a survivor in a zombie invasion. The objective is to survive as long as possible. Every game is randomly generated so no round will be the same.

The game will be updated daily with new encounters and features. A multi-player version is planned for a future release.
